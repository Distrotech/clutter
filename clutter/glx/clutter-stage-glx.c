/* A redraw clip represents (in stage coordinates) the bounding box of
 * something that needs to be redraw. Typically they are added to the
 * StageWindow as a result of clutter_actor_queue_clipped_redraw() by
 * actors such as ClutterGLXTexturePixmap. All redraw clips are
 * discarded after the next paint.
 *
 * A NULL stage_clip means the whole stage needs to be redrawn.
 *
 * What we do with this information:
 * - we keep track of the bounding box for all redraw clips
 * - when we come to redraw; if the bounding box is smaller than the
 *   stage we scissor the redraw to that box and use
 *   GLX_MESA_copy_sub_buffer to present the redraw to the front
 *   buffer.
 *
 * XXX - In theory, we should have some sort of heuristics to promote
 * a clipped redraw to a full screen redraw; in reality, it turns out
 * that promotion is fairly expensive. See the Clutter bug described
 * at: http://bugzilla.clutter-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2136 .
 *
 * TODO - we should use different heuristics depending on whether the
 * framebuffer is on screen and not redirected by a compositor VS
 * offscreen (either due to compositor redirection or because we are
 * rendering to a CoglOffscreen framebuffer)
 *
 * When not redirected glXCopySubBuffer (on intel hardware at least)
 * will block the GPU until the vertical trace is at the optimal point
 * so the copy can be done without tearing. In this case we don't want
 * to copy tall regions because they increase the average time spent
 * blocking the GPU.
 *
 * When rendering offscreen (CoglOffscreen or redirected by
 * compositor) then no extra synchronization is needed before the copy
 * can start.
 *
 * In all cases we need to consider that glXCopySubBuffer implies a
 * blit which may be avoided by promoting to a full stage redraw if:
 * - the framebuffer is redirected offscreen or a CoglOffscreen.
 * - the framebuffer is onscreen and fullscreen.
 * By promoting to a full stage redraw we trade off the cost involved
 * in rasterizing the extra pixels vs avoiding to use a blit to
 * present the back buffer.
