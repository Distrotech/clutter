 * @short_description: Implementation of the ATK interfaces for a #ClutterStage
 * @see_also: #ClutterStage
 *
 * #CallyStage implements the required ATK interfaces for #ClutterStage
 *
 * Some implementation details: at this moment #CallyStage is used as
 * the most similar Window object in this toolkit (ie: emitting window
 * related signals), although the real purpose of #ClutterStage is
 * being a canvas. Anyway, this is required for applications using
 * just clutter, or directly #ClutterStage
